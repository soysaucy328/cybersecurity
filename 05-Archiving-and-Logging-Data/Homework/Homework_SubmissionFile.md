### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
    tar -xvvf TarDocs.tar 

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
    tar -cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude="TarDocs/Documents/Java" TarDocs/

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
    tar -tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep -i "Java"

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
    sudo tar -cvvf --listed-incremental=snapshot.file --level=0 /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
-x extracts the archive and -c creates an archive so it doesn't make sense to use them at the same time.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
You have to edit the crontab

crontab -e 

then add a line to it

0 6 * * 3 sudo tar -czvf auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:

mdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    
#!/bin/bash


#creates the four directories first

mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,diskuse}

#prints free memory information and prints it to free_mem.txt

sudo free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

#prints disk usage information to disk_usage.txt

sudo du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

#lists open files and prints to open_list.txt

sudo lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

#prints free disk info to free_disk.txt

sudo df -h > ~/backups/diskuse/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:

chmod u+x ~/system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:

cat ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

cat ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

cat ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

cat ~/backups/diskuse/free_disk.txt
**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

sudo cp ~/system.sh /etc/cron.weekly
---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

/var/log/auth.log {
    weekly
    rotate 7
    notifempty
    delaycompression
    missingok
}

---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:

systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
   max_log_file = 35
   num_logs = 7
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    -w /etc/shawdow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
    
    -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
    
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:

sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:

auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report:

sudo aureport -au

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

sudo useradd atacker

sudo aureport -m

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

sudo auditctl -l

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```
